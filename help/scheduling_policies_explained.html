<h1>Scheduling Policies</h1><br>
Scheduling policies are a convenient and flexible way to control how users of this system can make or cancel reservations.  Policies are cumulative, meaning that the most restrictive will apply.
<br>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Name:</div></td>
	<td>A meaningful name that will be used to identify the policy on the club preferences page.  If someone does try to make a reservation that violates
	this policy, the name will be used in the message displayed to the user.  So, if you have someone come up to you saying that a policy  prevented them
	from making a reservation, they should be able to tell you which exact policy it was.  This should help you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Description:</div></td>
	<td>A detailed description of this policy.  This is only used for you to write a little note about the policy.  Unlike, the policy name the 
	  description will not be displayed in any error message to the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Type:</div></td>
	<td>Scheduling policies can be made as either as Reservation policies or cancellation policies.  
	A reservation policy will control how many reservations can be made by a user whereas a cancellation policy 
	will control how many cancellations can be made by a user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Schedule Limit:</div></td>
	<td>This represents the daily limit imposed per court.  For a reservation policy, this is the number of reservations that can be made by a user per day.  For cancellation policy, this is the number of cancellations that can be made by a user per day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Court:</div></td>
	<td>Scheduling policies can be applied selectively to individual courts or can be applied to all courts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Allow Looking for a Match:</div></td>
	<td>This restricts people from signing up for a singles court and looking for a partner. By Default this is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Allow Back to Back Reservations:</div></td>
	<td>With this one, you just can't make back to back reservations, pretty much as you would expect. By Default this is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Day of Week:</div></td>
	<td>Scheduling polices can be applied selectively to specific days or can be applied to all days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Specify Window:</div></td>
	<td>Optionally, scheduling windows can be specified.  A scheduling window can be created to block off a time range.  This can be used to specify.  When a scheduling window is not specified, the scheduling policy applies for the entire day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">Start Time:</div></td>
	<td>When the specify window checkbox is checked, the start time represents the time of day that the policy will be enforced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><div class="label">End Time:</div></td>
	<td>When the specify window checkbox is checked, the start time represents the time of day that policy is no longer enforced.</td>
</tr>
