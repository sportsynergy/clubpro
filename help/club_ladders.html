<h1>Club Ladders</h1>
<p>
  A Club Ladder is a ranking of players not on their assigned ranking but rather on their record with other players.  When you beat someone ranked higher on the ladder
  you take their position and they drop down one spot.  
</p>

<p>
To challenge someone in the ladder click on the little green symbol
<img src="../images/add_small.png"/>. This will bring up a page where you can send the person a short message.  Click
Send Message and you are on your way. A challenge match itself is a best of five using English scoring to 9.  
</p>

<p>
English scoring is also called hand-out scoring. Under this system, if the server wins a rally, they receive a point, while if the returner wins the rally, only the service changes (i.e., the ball goes "hand-out") and no point is given.  The first player to reach 9 points wins the game.  However, if the score reaches 8-8, the player who was first to reach 8 decides whether the game will be played to 9, as before (called "set one"), or to 10 (called "set two"). The player that wins the best of 5 games wins the match.
</p>

<p>
When the match is complete, record the result in the Recent Challenge Matches section.
</p>


<p>
You may notice a little lock symbols <img src="../images/lock.png"/> next to names in the ladder.  This indicates that the player is currently in a challenge match, which means that they have to report the score of their challenge match before they can be challenged or challenge someone else
If you have any questions (or suggestions) on how the ladder works feel free to drop us a line: <a href="mailto:support@sportsynergy.net">support@sportsynergy.net</a>
