<h1>Club Ladders</h1>
<font class="normalsm">

<p>
A Club Ladder is a ranking of players not on their assigned ranking but rather on their record with other players.  When you beat someone ranked higher on the ladder
you take their position and they drop down one spot.  
</p>

<p>
Not every single match you play will necessarily count toward your ladder.  To have your match count in the ladder you have to select Challenge Match as the 
Match Type when you are making the reservation.  Of course, the other thing is that both you and your opponent need to be in the Ladder
</p>
<p>
When you start the ladder, as in a perfect meritocracy, you will start at the bottom and have to work your way up.  If you decide to remove yourself and then later decide you want to 
get back in, guess what?  Yep, back to the bottom of the pile you go.
