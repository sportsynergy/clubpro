<h1>Match Types</h1>
<font class="normal">

<p>
A court reservation can be made as one of a few possible match types.  
</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">A Practice Match</span> is used for those informal games.  
</p>

<p>
When you want to take things up a notch, go with a <span class="bold">Challenge Match</span>. 
A Challenge Match will adjust the players rankings upon recording the match result using a nationally recognized ranking algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
A <span class="bold">Solo Match</span> is for when you don't have anyone to play with and more importantly, you don't
want anyone to play with.  
</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">League Matches</span> will be recorded in the Box League.  If you don't see this Match Type in the drop down, that means that your club doesn't have leagues going on.
