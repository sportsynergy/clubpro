<font class=normalsm>

<p>
A court reservation can be made as one of three possible match types.  A practice match will adjust the players rankings
 upon recording the match results using a nationally recognized ranking algorithim.    A challenge match will adjust the players rankings upon recording the match result for two times the weight of 
 a practice match. A box league match will adjust the players
 rankings upon recording the match results for two times the weight of a practice match plus adjust the position of the two players
 in their box league.
