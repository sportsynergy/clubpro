<h1>Box Leagues</h1>
<font class=normalsm>

<p>
Box leagues are designed after the ever popular box leagues used widely across England. They are perfect for the member who wants a competitive squash match each week, and where the results are clearly reflected in the club rankings.  
</p> 
 
<p>
 How the box league works is very simple. Each player has to play all the other players in his/her box within an allotted period of  time. At the end of the period, the player(s) with the most points move up a box, while the player(s) with the fewest points move down. One point is awarded for just showing up to play, another for every game won, and another for every match won. Example:  If Player A beats Player B 3-2, A gets five points, and B gets three.  At the end of the time period, the boxes are adjusted, and the process repeats, until the box league season ends. 

<p>
When reserving a court for a box league match select "Box League" from the available match types.  To look for a box league match, simply select "I am looking for match" and emails will be sent out to all other players in the box.
