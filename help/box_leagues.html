<h1>Box Leagues</h1>
<p>Box leagues are designed after the ever-popular box leagues used widely across England. They are perfect for the member who wants a competitive squash match each week, and where the results are clearly reflected in the club rankings. 
</p>
<p>How the box league works is very simple. Each player has to play all the other players in his/her box within an allotted period of time. At the end of the period, the player(s) with the most points move up a box, while the player(s) with the fewest points move down. One point is awarded for just showing up to play, another for every game won, another for every match won, and a bonus point is awarded to the guy who wins 3-0. Example: If Player [A] beats Player [B] 3-2, [A] gets five points, and [B] gets three. At the end of the time period, the boxes are adjusted, and the process repeats, until the box league season ends.
