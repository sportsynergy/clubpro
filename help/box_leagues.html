<h1>Box Leagues</h1>
<p>Box leagues are designed after the ever-popular box leagues used widely across England. They are perfect for the member who wants a competitive squash match each week, and where the results are clearly reflected in the club rankings. 
</p>
<p>How the box league works is very simple. Each player has to play all the other players in his/her box within an allotted period of time. At the end of the period, the player(s) with the most points move up a box, while the player(s) with the fewest points move down. One point is awarded for just showing up to play, another for every game won and two bonus points are awarded to the guy who wins 3-0. 
</p>
Example:	
<ul>	
	<li>3/0 = 6 points to the winner, 1 point to the loser. </li>
	<li>3/1 = 5 points to the winner, 2 points to the loser. </li>
	<li>3/2 = 4 points to the winner, 3 points to the loser. </li>
		 
</ul>
<p>When reserving a court for a box league match - select &quot;Box League&quot; from the available match types. To look for a box league match, simply select &quot;I am looking for match&quot; and emails will be sent out to all other players in the box.</p>
