          Ok, we've got your registration.  At this very moment we are filing it away.  In a few minutes you should 
          get an email from us that will have all sorts of goodies including the link of your new online reservation
          system and a user name and password you can use to log in with.  Thanks for trying us out.  In our opinion,
          this is the smartest thing you have done all day.
